          <h2>Lins and your water</h2>
          <p>The waters, from the magnificent Guarani aquifer,
             have a temperature between 37 and 40 degrees and their properties are similar to those found in the French city of Vichy, 
             that is, the waters of Lins have very rich properties that are comparable to those of a very rare medicinal water that is only found in France!</p>

          <h2>Lins was the name of a person… who had never been to Lins!</h2>
          <p>On February 16, 1908, Afonso Pena, President of the Republic,
             inaugurated a section containing four important stations in the region.
             Among these was kilometer 152, known as “Estação Campestre”,
             close to the stream of the same name. This station was named “Albuquerque Lins”,
             in honor of the Alagoas politician Manuel Joaquim de Albuquerque Lins,
             who would be president (today, governor) of the state of São Paulo between 1908 and 1912.
             Despite being honored, he was never here. If so, why was he honored? Among the 4 stations,
             there was Cafelândia, which when opened was named after Afonso Pena. Keeping the current and fulfilling the need to name the place,
             it was then decided to pay homage to the state governor. This name remained until 1926. In 1927 it became just “LINS”.</p>

          <h2>Wooden stadium</h2>
          <p>The Madeira Giant, as it was popularly known, hosted Linense's great victory against the São Paulo club (4×1).
             In 1958 this stadium was completely demolished and its land was subdivided.
             Today the Amiguinho Supermercado is located on the site.</p>

          <h2>Novel “Stupid Cupid”</h2>
          <p>Produced and shown by Rede Globo between 1976 and 1977,
             the novel consists of 160 chapters and was the last work recorded in black and white.
             The novel opera was recorded in a fictional environment called Albuquerque, a city in the interior of São Paulo.
            <br>
            <br>
             Although we would like to, the work was not recorded in Lins, but heavily inspired by her.
             The Linense author, Mário Prata, shows pride in having started writing on Linense soil and the fictional city seems 
             to be a fair tribute of love for it, also considering that Lins was previously called Albuquerque Lins, as explained 
             in the item above.</p>
